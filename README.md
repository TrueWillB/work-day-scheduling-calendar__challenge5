# work-day-scheduling-calendar\_\_challenge5

This is a calendar into which a user can save events. The events will persist even when the user leaves the page and come back

# Important notes for operation

The user should be aware that clicking a save button will ONLY save the event adjacent to that save button, it will NOT save all of the events at once.]

## General Notes

- I designed the script for the calendar behavior so that a future coder should be able to add more timeslots to the calendar in the HTML and the JS should not have to be altered at all in order to preserve the functionality
- The user will be able to save events and close the site. Upon reopening, any saved events will be loaded back into the site
